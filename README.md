# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains Python code for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks on a dataset of customer reviews using various techniques and packages. Below is a summary of the code and its functionality:

General Packages
numpy, pandas: These packages are used for data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot: These packages are used for data visualization.
os: This package is used for operating system-related tasks.
NLP Packages
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit is used for natural language processing tasks.
sklearn.feature_extraction.text: This package is used to convert text data into numerical features.
collections: It's used to handle collections of items, such as counting tokens.
wordcloud: This package is used to create word clouds for text visualization.
Modeling Packages
sklearn.model_selection: This package is used for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression: Logistic regression is used for sentiment analysis.
sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier: Random Forest classifier is used for sentiment analysis.
sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score: This metric is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.
sklearn.metrics.f1_score: The F1 score is used as an additional metric for evaluation.
Code Overview
The code performs various tasks, including data preprocessing, text analysis, sentiment analysis, and model evaluation. Here's a brief description of what each section does:

Data Loading: Loads a dataset named 'CustomerReview.csv' using pandas.

Text Analysis and Visualization:

Calculates the number of words in each review and creates a histogram.
Visualizes the distribution of review scores as a bar plot.
Generates a word cloud to visualize the most frequent words in the reviews.
Data Preprocessing:

Removes neutral reviews with a score of 3.
Converts text to lowercase.
Tokenizes the text into words.
Stopword Removal:

Removes common English stopwords.
Stemming and Lemmatization:

Applies stemming and lemmatization to the text data.
Sentiment Analysis:

Assigns sentiment ratings to reviews based on their scores.
Visualizes the distribution of sentiment ratings as a bar plot.
Feature Engineering:

Converts text data into a word-document matrix using Bag of Words (BoW) representation.
Creates n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and four-grams) features.
Transforms text data into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors.
Model Building:

Trains a logistic regression model on both BoW and TF-IDF representations.
Evaluates the model's performance using the F1 score.
Feature Importance:

Ranks the most important features (words) for positive and negative sentiment using logistic regression coefficients.
Running the Code
To run the code, make sure you have Python and the required packages installed. You can execute the code in a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook. Ensure that the 'CustomerReview.csv' dataset is in the same directory as the code or specify the correct file path.

The code provides insights into text analysis, sentiment analysis, and feature engineering for NLP tasks, making it a valuable resource for analyzing customer reviews or similar text data.

Additional Notes
This code provides a comprehensive analysis of text data and demonstrates common preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
It also showcases two different methods of feature engineering: Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, which are commonly used for text-based machine learning tasks.
Sentiment analysis is performed to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their scores.
The F1 score is used as a performance metric to evaluate the machine learning models. F1 score combines precision and recall and is especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
Feature importance is visualized to understand which words have the most impact on sentiment classification.
Possible Improvements
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines, to see if they improve model performance.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for the models to optimize their performance.
Explore deep learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models (e.g., BERT), for sentiment analysis, which may capture more complex patterns in the text.
Consider using cross-validation for a more robust evaluation of the models.
Apply more advanced text preprocessing techniques, such as handling misspellings, emojis, or handling negations (e.g., "not good").
Collect more data to potentially improve model accuracy and generalization.
Visualize the results and insights in a more user-friendly format, such as a dashboard or report.
Important Considerations
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and data files (e.g., 'CustomerReview.csv') before running the code.
Keep in mind that the code provided is a starting point and may require further customization and optimization for specific use cases and datasets.
Always validate and interpret the results of sentiment analysis in the context of your particular application. Sentiment analysis models may have limitations and biases.
Handle imbalanced datasets appropriately, especially when evaluating model performance. Techniques like oversampling or using different evaluation metrics can be helpful.
By following these considerations and potential improvements, you can build more robust and accurate sentiment analysis models for your specific text data.
